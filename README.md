## About Me

Hi, I'm Matthieu, an **AI/ML Enginerd** who scales infrastructure to deploy models, and develops models to scale infrastructure. I lead teams through MLOps pipelines while going from localhost:8000 to production. From data acquisition and deep learning model development to production deployment and infra scaling, I turn coffee into releases ‚Äî because someone has to keep the api rolling.

I graduated from **√âcole Polytechnique** and **ENSAE Paris Tech** with specialized focus in Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, and autonomous agent architectures.
